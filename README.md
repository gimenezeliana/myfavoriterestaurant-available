# myfavoriterestaurant-available
I made a script to check if my favorite restaurant has reservations available. 

In order to do that I navigated the web code, once I got the right link I utilized requests and json get the link and make a function to find out if this place has spots available or not. If it is available I receive an email letting me know about it and with the link to reserve right away.

Then I added a timer so the function runs everyday at certain hour.
